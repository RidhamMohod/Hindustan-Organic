                <h2>What is Isopropyl alcohol(IPA)?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol and also called isopropanol or 2-propanol) is a colorless, flammable organic
                compound with a pungent alcoholic odor.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Isopropyl alcohol, an organic polar molecule, is miscible in water, ethanol, and chloroform, demonstrating its ability
                to dissolve a wide range of substances including ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, oils, alkaloids, and natural
                resins. Notably, it is not miscible with salt solutions and can be separated by adding sodium chloride in a process
                known as salting out. It forms an azeotrope with water, resulting in a boiling point of 80.37 °C and is characterized by
                its slightly bitter taste.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Isopropyl Alcohol used for?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol, has many uses, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medical: Isopropyl alcohol is used in rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizers, and wet wipes. It can also be used to ease an
                    ear infection by mixing it with white vinegar.</li>
                    <li>Cosmetics: Isopropyl alcohol is used in cosmetics like body rubs, hand lotions, and aftershave lotions.</li>
                    <li>Industrial solvent: Isopropyl alcohol is used as a solvent for gums, resins, creosote, shellac, and essential oils.</li>
                    <li>Quick-drying inks and oils: Isopropyl alcohol is used in quick-drying inks and oils.</li>
                    <li>Antifreeze: Isopropyl alcohol is used in antifreeze compositions.</li>
                    <li>Chemical manufacturing: Isopropyl alcohol is used in the manufacture of acetone, glycerol, and isopropyl acetate.</li>
                    <li>Denaturing ethanol: Isopropyl alcohol is used to denature ethanol (ethyl alcohol).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <h2>How is Isopropyl alcohol(IPA) produced? </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The primary method of production of isopropyl alcohol is by combining water and propene in a reaction called hydration.
                It can also be produced by the hydrogenation of acetone. In both the processes of the production of isopropyl alcohol,
                separation is required. The product isopropyl alcohol is required to be separated from by-products like water. This is
                done by the process of distillation.
                
                In the case of simple distillation, isopropyl alcohol forms a solution that is 87.9% by weight isopropyl alcohol and the
                rest is water. This is an azeotropic solution and has a common boiling point of the mixture. Thus, to obtain pure
                isopropyl alcohol, we need to carry out azeotropic distillation. This process is done by using azeotroping agents like
                cyclohexane and di-isopropyl ether. The body also produces small amounts of isopropyl alcohol in the process of diabetic
                ketoacidosis.</p>
