                <h2>What is Toluene?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Toluene is a clear water-insoluble solvent with a molecular formula of C7H8. It has an aromatic, benzene-like smell and
                is a highly volatile flammable liquid with a flash point of 4° C. It is obtained from petroleum and coal tar and is
                predominantly used as a solvent in the manufacturing of other organic chemicals.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Toluene used for?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                    The main chemical use of toluene is to make benzene, xylenes and other solvents. It can also be used to manufacture
                    other chemicals such as phenol, nitrobenzene, benzoic acid and benzyl chloride. As a solvent, toluene can be used in
                    paints, paint thinners, adhesives, inks, resins, cleaning agents, leather tanners and inks. It can also be used to
                    manufacture polymers that produce nylon, plastic soda bottles and for pharmaceuticals, dyes and cosmetic products.
                    Toluene is also used as a coolant in sodium cold traps underneath nuclear reactor loops. The user end markets of this
                    product are the chemical, paints, adhesive, cleaning, leather, plastics, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.

                <h2>How is it produced? </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Toluene is naturally released into the atmosphere from the following: petroleum fuels, toluene-based solvents, thinners
                and from motor vehicle exhaust fumes. The current method to chemically manufacture toluene is through a catalytic
                reforming process. A hydrocarbon mixture which is rich in aromatics is passed over a dehydrated catalyst and then
                obtained from a cut of the distillation or solvent extraction process.</p>
