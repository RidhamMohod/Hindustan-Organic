                <h2>What is Ethyl Acetate?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Ethyl Acetate is an organic ester compound with a molecular formula of C4H8O2. It is commonly used as a solvent for
                cleaning, paint removal and coatings. It is a colourless liquid with a fruity characteristic odour that is commonly
                recognised in glues and nail polish remover. This product is highly flammable with a flash point of -4° C and a
                flammability rating of 3. It is highly miscible with all common organic solvents (alcohols, ketones, glycols, esters)
                but only slightly miscibility in water.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Ethyl Acetate used for?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Ethyl acetate is most commonly used as a solvent (due to its dilution properties). As a high purity solvent, it is used
                in cleaning electric circuit boards and as a nail polish remover. At a lower purity, it can be used as in printing,
                pharmaceuticals, perfumes, food, decaffeination of tea/coffee and a carrier solvent for herbicides. Ethyl acetate is
                also used in coating formulations for wood furniture, agricultural, construction equipment, mining equipment and marine
                uses. It is also naturally produced in wine during the fermentation process. The main user end markets of these product
                are the electronics, cosmetic, printing, food and coatings industries.

                <h2>How is it produced? </h2>
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Ethyl acetate is mainly manufactured via the esterification of ethanol and acetic acid in the presence of a strong acid.
                In this process, a small amount of sulphuric acid is preheated and fed to an esterifing column to be refluxed. The
                mixture then goes though to a second refluxing column, to remove around 85% ethyl acetate. Water is mixed in, which
                causes a separation into two layers and the residue is fed into another refluxing column to remove any final impurities
                to manufacture 95% ethyl acetate.</p>
